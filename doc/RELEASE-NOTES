UnrealIRCd 4.0.18-devel Release Notes
======================================

UnrealIRCd 4.0.18-devel is work in progress.

==[ CHANGES BETWEEN 4.0.17 AND 4.0.18 ]==

Enhancements:
* None

Major issues fixed:
* The new optional feature 'set::cloak-method ip' caused identical cloaks

Minor issues fixed:
* When using '/REHASH -ssl' or './unrealircd reloadtls' it did not reload
  the SSL certificate/key if you were using ssl-options in listen, sni or
  link blocks. In short: it only reloaded the ones from set::ssl until now.

Other:
* The built-in time synchronization feature is now disabled by default.
  TimeSynch was added back in 2006 when lot's of operating systems did not
  ship with time synchronization turned on by default. Since incorrect time
  severely breaks IRC networks this was a major problem. Nowadays this is
  completely different with most Linux distro's, OS X, Windows, etc. doing
  time synchronization out of the box. Since UnrealIRCd's implementation is
  less precise and lacks authentication it's best left over to the system.
  You can still re-enable timesynch via:
  set { timesynch { enabled yes; }; };
  .. but you should really use NTP or similar for system-wide time
  synchronization instead.
* Just as a reminder (this change was already in version 4.0.17):
  UnrealIRCd will no longer give user mode +z to users on WEBIRC
  gateways using SSL/TLS IRC, unless the WEBIRC gateway gives us
  some assurance that the client<->webirc gateway connection is
  also secure (eg: https).
  This is the regular WEBIRC format:
  WEBIRC password gateway hostname ip
  This indicates a secure client connection (NEW):
  WEBIRC password gateway hostname ip :secure
  Naturally, WEBIRC gateways MUST NOT send the "secure" option if
  the client is using http or some other insecure protocol.

Module coders:
* New hook HOOKTYPE_CAN_BYPASS_CHANNEL_MESSAGE_RESTRICTION
